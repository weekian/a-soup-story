      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p class="reasons">
        The idea of A Soup Story came up as we were eating at a newly-discovered Japanese restaurant. We are always looking at new places to eat, especially when we see good reviews and advertisements on Facebook. "Is it really that good?" - that is the question. We thought that this would be a good way to encourage us to try out new places to eat, and hopefully, you too, because there are so many restaurants, cafes, hawker centres and food courts out there, so how can we stick to just a few in our lives? As Wee Kian always says, "I'd rather live a shorter life eating what I want to eat than live a long and boring life.".
